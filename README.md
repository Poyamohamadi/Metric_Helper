## Structure

The code is organized into the following components:

1. **Main Application Class (`MyApp`)**:
   - Inherits from `customtkinter.CTk` to create the main application window.
   - Initializes the GUI elements such as input/output fields, comboboxes, and buttons.

2. **GUI Elements**:
   - **Input Field**: For entering the numerical value.
   - **Comboboxes**: Dropdown menus for selecting metric prefixes.
   - **Convert Button**: Triggers the conversion logic.
   - **Output Field**: Displays the converted value.

3. **Conversion Logic (`convert` Method)**:
   - Uses a dictionary (`metric_values`) to map metric prefixes to their respective powers of 10.
   - Converts the input value to its base unit and then to the desired output prefix.

4. **Main Execution Block**:
   - Ensures the application runs only when executed directly.

## Dependencies

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **customtkinter**: A modern GUI library for Python. Install it using:
